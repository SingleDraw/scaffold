## Quick Usage (Detached from Repo)

### Option 1: Download ZIP from GitHub
1. Go to the branch you want on GitHub.  
2. Click **Code â†’ Download ZIP**.  
3. Extract it anywhere. You now have a standalone project.

### Option 2: Use `git archive` (CLI)
```bash
git archive --remote=https://github.com/your-username/scaffold.git <branch-name> | tar -x -C my-project
````

* Replace `<branch-name>` with `typescript`, `ts-module`, or `react`.
* `my-project` is the folder where you want the scaffold.
* The resulting project is **completely detached** from the original repo.
